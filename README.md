# Find the Number Game

## Overview

Find the Number is a simple game that challenges the player to guess a random number within a range of 1-1000 . The game is implemented in Python programming language and involves generating a random number between 1 and 1000. The player inputs their guesses, and the program provides feedback on the correctness of the guess along with hints to help narrow down subsequent guesses. The game continues until the player guesses the correct number or reaches the maximum allowed guesses, set at 10 in this implementation.

## Features

- Generates a random number within a specified range.
- Allows the player to input guesses and provides feedback.
- Provides hints to guide the player in narrowing down their guesses.
- Implements error handling to ensure valid user inputs (integer values only).
- Displays messages after each guess for a more user-friendly experience.
- Allows the player to choose a new range of numbers for added functionality.

## Getting Started

To run the game, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your machine.
2. Download or clone the repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/find-the-number-game.git
```
3. Run the game


## Usage

- Enter your guesses when prompted.
- Receive feedback and hints after each guess.
- Continue guessing until you find the correct number or reach the maximum allowed guesses.

## Contributing
