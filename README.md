"Find the Number" is a simple game that challenges the player to guess a random number within a given range.
In my implementation of the game, I used Python programming language to generate a random number between a 1 and 1000.
The player then inputs their guess and the program checks if the guess is correct or not.
If the guess is incorrect, the program provides a hint to the player to help them narrow down their next guess.
The game continues until the player guesses the correct number or reaches the maximum number of allowed guesses which is 10 in my implementation. 
To add more functionality to the game, I implemented error handling to ensure that the user inputs valid data, such as integer values only.
I also added some features to make the game more user-friendly, such as displaying messages to the player after each guess and allowing them to choose a new range of numbers. 
Overall, this project helped me practice fundamental programming concepts such as conditional statements, loops, functions, and error handling.
It also allowed me to showcase my problem-solving skills by finding efficient and effective ways to generate a random number and provide hints to the player.
